# Boredomcraft
Minecraft Mod

  A Minecraft modification for 1.10+

  In a similar vein to mods such as OpenBlocks or Random Things, Boredomcraft seeks to add a variety of blocks,
tools, and features with limited-to-no connection to one another.

  It also will serve as a central library for any other mods I may develop in the future.
